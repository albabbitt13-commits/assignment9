Design Memo

A graph is the correct data structure to represent a social network because 
social relationships are naturally modeled as connections between individuals. 
In this case, each person represents a node, and each friendship represents 
an edge. Since friendships are mutual, the graph is undirected, meaning each 
connection goes both ways. Using an adjacency list allows each Person object 
to store a list of their direct friends efficiently.

A list would not work well because it does not naturally represent 
relationships between elements. While a list could store people, it would not 
efficiently show how each person is connected to others. A tree would also be 
inappropriate because trees enforce a hierarchical structure with parent-child 
relationships. Social networks are not hierarchical — people can have multiple 
connections in many directions, and cycles are common. Trees do not allow 
cycles, but social networks do.

One trade-off I noticed is that checking for duplicate friendships requires 
searching the friend list, which takes linear time. However, printing the 
network is efficient because we simply iterate through each person and display 
their adjacency list. The adjacency list structure is memory efficient compared 
to an adjacency matrix, especially when the network is sparse. Overall, graphs 
provide both the flexibility and performance needed to accurately model 
dynamic, real-world social relationships.
